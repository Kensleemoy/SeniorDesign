At the state level, statistics provided include population, number of cases, number of deaths, total number of  hospital beds, hospital beds used by COVID patients, total number of ICU beds, ICU beds used by COVID patients.  At the county level, the number of hospital or ICU beds used by COVID patients is not typically available, so these statistics are not included.

The map is interactive; clicking on a county will pull up county stats in the table. Deselecting a county will remove it from the table.

## What we worked on
We worked as a team and employed the AGILE process, meeting at least once a week to coordinate and troubleshoot any issues that arose. We split up the work into 3 main parts: UI, API calls, and features. This allowed us to work fairly independently to provide a finished product in a reasonable amount of time.
